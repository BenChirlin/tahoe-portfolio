      <p>Welcome. I am a full stack engineer in the Bay Area and nothing makes me happier than a beautiful site with gorgeous code beneath the surface. Most recently I've been working on data migrations, complex site features, and API integrations all at massive scale.</p>
      <p>Currently Iâ€™m looking for my next big move. I'd love to find a position at a company with an exciting mission where I can learn new skills and tools, especially for cutting edge platforms like mobile, virtual reality, and progressive web applications. If you know of something drop me a line at <a title='Email me' href='mailto:info@benjaminchirlin.com' target='_blank'>info@benjaminchirlin.com</a>.</p>
      <p>You can find me elsewhere around the web at {
        socialLinks.map((platform, index, socialLinks) => <span key={index}>{index === socialLinks.length - 1 ? 'and ' : '' }<SocialLink title={platform.title} url={platform.url} icon={false} />{index <socialLinks.length - 1 ? ', ' : ''}</span>)
