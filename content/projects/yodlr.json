  "synopsis": "When given time to pursue a pet project at *The Mechanism*, I chose to make my own simple iOS application from scratch along with supporting online service after having had a bad experience with framework-based development for *My Morning Jacket*. This experimental project anonymously shared whatever song you were listening to on a map for other users to explore.\n\nThe app sent this listening information to a simple Node Mongo API I made in order to track song and geolocation data while allowing for location-based queries.\n\nI designed and developed the entire project myself, along with [a small microsite](http://yodlr.themechanism.com/) to describe and promote it. The application is no longer available on the App Store.",
