  "synopsis": "When given time to pursue a pet project at the Mechanism, I chose to make my own simple iOS application and service from scratch. The experimental project anonymously shared whatever song you were listening to on a map for other users to explore. To support this I created a simple Node Mongo API to track song and geolocation data while allowing for location-based queries. The application is no longer available on the App Store.",
