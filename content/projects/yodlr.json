  "synopsis": "When given time to pursue a pet project at *The Mechanism*, I chose to make my own simple iOS application with supporting online service from scratch. The experimental project anonymously shared whatever song you were listening to on a map for other users to explore.\n\nThe app then communicated with a simple Node Mongo API I made in order to track song and geolocation data while allowing for location-based queries.\n\nI designed and developed the entire project myself, along with [a small microsite](http://yodlr.themechanism.com/) to desribe and promote it. The application is no longer available on the App Store.",
