  "synopsis": "Once I'd helped establish a common database and theme with our \"Pangea\" project it was time to modernize the magazine's digital infrastructure. My team and I replatformed the entire site to a custom Node/React based Cond√© Nast content management system called *Copilot*.\n\nMy first duty was spearheading data migration from our Wordpress site via a custom plug-in that exported data directly via the new CMS' API. That task complete, I jumped on board with the rest of the team implementing the various site features we had to recreate in React as well as improvements.",
