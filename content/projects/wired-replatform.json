  "synopsis": "Once a common database and theme were established during our \"Pangea\" project it was time to modernize WIRED's digital infrastructure. My team and I replatformed the entire site to a new Node/React based Cond√© Nast content management system. I was largely responsible for data migration in the form of a custom Wordpress plugin. That task complete, I later jumped on board with the rest of the team implementing various site features and improvements.",
