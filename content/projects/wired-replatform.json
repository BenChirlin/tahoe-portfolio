  "synopsis": "Once I'd helped establish a common database and theme with our \"Pangea\" project it was time to modernize *WIRED*'s digital infrastructure. My team and I replatformed the entire site to a new Node/React based Cond√© Nast content management system called *Copilot*.\n\nMy primary duty was data migration from our Wordpress site via a customized plugin that exported data directly via the new CMS' API. That task complete, I later jumped on board with the rest of the team implementing various site features and improvements.",
