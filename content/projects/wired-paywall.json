  "synopsis": "I was the lead developer at WIRED for the site's paywall project across the entire stack. This product had to integrate a third party tracking service, [Evolok](https://www.evolok.com/), with client side user data. Much of this happened at our Fastly edge server, all with intelligent caching to boot.",
