  "synopsis": "I was the lead product engineer at *WIRED* for the site's paywall project across the entire stack. This involved collaboration across many teams at Cond√© Nast and beyond to ensure a smooth launch for this massive product shift.\n\nThis work included integrating a third party tracking service, [Evolok](https://www.evolok.com/), with client side user data all on the Fastly edge server.\n\nSince *WIRED* gets millions of visits, ensuring the entire project scaled and cached correctly was a difficult but inspiring challenge.",
