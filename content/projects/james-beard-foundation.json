  "synopsis": "While at the Mechanism I worked on a small team to help realize a modern website for this illustrious non-profit (since replaced). Building upon Drupal and with designs from the client, we fleshed out the site. I was also given the opportunity to design and build certain features that were missing from the original specifications like the calendar widget. I was largely responsible for the front end while also customizing some back end configurations and the like.",
