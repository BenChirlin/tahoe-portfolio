  "synopsis": "I'm currently working at [*Twitch.tv*](https://www.twitch.tv/) on the Creator Experience team. Our goal is to support and empower the many diverse creators on the platform, helping them build their audience while improving the quality of their content. I specifically enjoy working on projects that I know will directly benefit the communities I so love on Twitch.\n\nBuilt on a React, GQL, and Go foundation with AWS, Twitch has been a fantastic place to learn new technologies while perfecting my front end skill set. I hope to continue expanding my knowledge of Go, AWS, and scaling projects. Some major projects I've already had the pleasure of working on have been [Squad Streaming](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2019/03/27/squad-stream-the-next-way-to-play-and-watch-together-32d9ad2ac555/) and the [new dashboard for creators](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/creator-dashboard).",
