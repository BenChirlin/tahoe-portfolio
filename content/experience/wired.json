  "synopsis": "Over four plus years of hard work at [*WIRED*](https://www.wired.com) magazine I helped migrate the venerable magazine from a messy array of Wordpress blogs to a unified in-house React application, all while maintaining over 25 years worth of priceless online content. This journey included everything from simple article features to massaging our caching layer.\n\nMy major projects included a massive redesign, two site replatforms, and the site's first paywall. See my project details below for more!",
