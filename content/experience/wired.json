  "synopsis": "Over four plus years of hard work at [*WIRED*](https://www.wired.com) magazine I helped migrate the venerable magazine from a messy array of Wordpress blogs to a unified in-house React application, all while maintaining over 25 years worth of priceless online content. Along the way this journey included everything from simple article features to getting intimate with our caching layer (a scary proposition when you're looking at millions of views of month).\n\nMy major projects included a massive redesign, two replatforms, and the site's first paywall. See my project details below for more!",
