  "synopsis": "I graduated from the [*University of Pennsylvania*](https://www.upenn.edu/) in 2011 with a Bachelors in Engineering and Science (BSE). I spent four challenging but rewarding years in the [*Digital Media Design*](http://cg.cis.upenn.edu/dmd_program.html) (DMD) program. About two thirds computer science and one third art, DMD was the crucible from which my skills and style emerged.\n\nSome classes I worked on while at Penn included web design, digital design, computer graphics, animation, and more.",
