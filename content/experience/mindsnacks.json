  "synopsis": "Going into my senior year of college I found a full time summer position at [*Mindsnacks*](https://www.mindsnacks.com/). Working, at that time, out of the Philadelphia incubator [*DreamIt*](http://www.dreamit.com/), we made the company's first iOS educational application to help teach Spanish.\n\nOriginally brought in to supplement professionally contracted work, I was soon appointed to do all the design work and asset creation after my boss, Jesse Pickard, recognized the breadth of my skill set.\n\nAfter I returned to my university studies the company went on to find great success with our application, being featured in the Apple iTunes App Store and later expanding to a full line of educational applications for different subjects.",

  "body": "I spent the summer of 2010 in Philadelphia leading up to my senior year of college. I found a fantastic opportunity at the local [DreamIt Ventures](http://www.dreamit.com/) with the start-up [Mindsnacks](http://mindsnacks.com/).\n\n[Mindsnacks](http://mindsnacks.com/) builds “delightful educational games for learners of all ages”. In those early days, our first target was a Spanish teaching iOS app whose framework could be used to teach numerous other languages and eventually topics.\n\nThough I was first hired as a temporary artist to help fill in the gaps between more senior contracted work, the founding partners of the soon realized I was capable of doing much more.\n\nI would be given a finished game concept (a spelling quiz, matching game, etc.) and then had to figure out how to present it in a fun engaging manner for the user, fitting our nature-driven aesthetic. I also helped design the user interface, learning much along the way about asset development for games as well as how to properly engage a user.\n\nThe company has since expanded it’s repertoire of sister apps on the iTunes store, being featured as one of the top educational apps on the platform, as well as expanding into the general brain training space. Though a brilliant new Art Director has completely rebranded the product since that distant Summer, I feel honored to have been there at the ground floor and treasure the relationships I built during that time.",
